# Tienda Nube design system respository

## Overview
The idea of this repository is to keep all the Tienda Nube sketch system organized and synchronize. We also want to open up to the design community, how we work and also how we create our design system.
 
## Quickstart ðŸ˜Ž
1. We are going to keep up to date our sketch files with [kaktus](https://github.com/kactus-io/kactus). Is a tool to bring proper version control (as in git) to designers (only sketch users for now).
2. Clone the repo in your local enviroment. You can do it, going to `clone or download` and click in `Open in Desktop`. 
3. Once you have the repo in kaktus, you can start creating a branch. Important! Do it from the `development` branch
4. Remember to create a pull request for all your changes. Add a Tienda Nube reviewer to watch your changes.
